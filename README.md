# Lacklustr_AccelStepper
Stripped down clone of [AccelStepper 1.51](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) (Arduino)

I was starting to hit the memory cap with a Pro Mini project of mine, so I removed all but the AccelStepper::DRIVER mode from this fork.

All credit should go to the original creator: Mike McCauley and AirSpayce Pty Ltd.
